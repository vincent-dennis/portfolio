# SpoTube

SpoTube is a chrome extension that can quickly generate a YouTube playlist out of a Spotify playlist. Made by Vincent Dennis Judyanto.

## Installation

If you want to try SpoTube:

1. Download the SpoTube .zip file
2. Unzip the file into a local folder
3. Open Google Chrome and go to chrome://extensions
4. On the top right corner, toggle on "Developer mode"
5. Click on "Load Unpacked", and choose the SpoTube folder

## Usage

For a demonstration watch the video "SpoTube demo"

1. Open a Spotify playlist that you would like to transfer to YouTube
2. Click on the extension icon, and when prompted, sign into both your Spotify account and Google account that is associated with your YouTube account.
3. Click on the "Generate Playlist" button, and wait for the generated playlist to appear.

The extension does NOT store any user sensitive data.

## Limitations

The extension uses both Spotify and YouTube Data API to function, and since YouTube Data API can only be used with a Cost Quota system, the extension can only transfer up to 66 songs per day. This extension was made as a learning project, and serves only as a proof of concept.
