							Albert Einstein was born in Ulm,
							in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879.

							Einstein taught himself algebra, Euclidian geometry and calculus at age 12,
							way ahead of his peers. 
							He was convinced that nature could be understood as a "mathematical structure".

							After passing the Swiss <em>Matura</em> or high school diploma with a grade of 6/6 in 
							physics and mathematical subjects, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics 
							teaching diploma program at the Federal polytechnic school. Einstein met his future wife,
							Mileva  Marić.

							After graduating, with the help of his friend Marcel Grossmann's father, 
							he secured a job in Bern at the Swiss Patent Office as an assistant examiner level III.

							Einstein married Mileva Marić, who was said to have also contributed on some of Einstein's
							early works. They had 2 sons, but ended up with a divorce 16 years later because Einstein's
							chief romantic attraction at the time was his cousin Elsa Löwenthal who he married in that same year.
							As part of their divorce agreements, Einstein agreed to give Marić any future Nobel Prize money.

							1905 - Einstein's so-called <i>annus mirabilis</i> (miracle year). He has published scientific
							papers since he was 21, but in 1905 alone he published four groundbreaking papers, 
							on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, 
							and the equivalence of mass and energy, 
							which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world. He was awarded a PhD the next year.

							By 1908 Einstein was recognized as a prominent scientist and was appointed as a lecturer
							in Zurich and later a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague,
							during which he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics
							and on the quantum theory of solids.

							Einstein earned a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922
							"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of 
							the law of the photoelectric effect".

							In July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, 
							scientists Leo Szilárd and Eugene Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs,
							which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. 
							He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to President Roosevelt, 
							recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.

							In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, 
							"I made one great mistake in my life — when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt 
							recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that 
							the Germans would make them ..."

							On 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic
							aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948.
							Einstein refused surgery, saying, "I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong
							life artificially. I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly."
							He died in the University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro early the next morning
							at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.
